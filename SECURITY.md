# Security & Legitimacy Notice

## This is a Legitimate Educational Project

**Solana x402 Learn & Earn** is an official entry for the Solana x402 Hackathon. This is NOT a phishing or scam website.

### Project Details

- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/heyhewi/Solanax402-Hackathon
- **Purpose**: Educational Learn-to-Earn platform demonstrating Solana x402 AI agents
- **Network**: Solana DEVNET (test network) - NO real money involved
- **Open Source**: Full source code available for review

### How It Works

1. **Users pay 0.05 SOL on DEVNET** to unlock 5 learning modules about Solana x402 AI agents
2. **Complete educational modules** with questions and answers
3. **Earn back 0.05 SOL** by completing all 5 modules (0.01 SOL per module)
4. **AI agent autonomously evaluates** answers and distributes rewards

### Why This Looks Like Phishing (But Isn't)

Security scanners may flag this site because it:
- Requests wallet connection (standard for Web3 apps)
- Asks users to send SOL (part of the learn-to-earn model)
- Has a faucet endpoint (for test SOL distribution)

However, this is a **legitimate educational platform**:
- Only uses Solana DEVNET (test network)
- Open source code on GitHub
- Part of official Solana x402 Hackathon
- Transparent payment and reward system
